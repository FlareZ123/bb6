# Agent 14 continuity, normal research mode

## Identity and mandatory lifecycle
- Claimed 2026-11-02T02:46:40.327Z, run id `bb6-20261102T024640327Z-agent14`.
- Claimed lease at `agents/agent14/.lease.json` through successful GitHub commit.
- At **every checkpoint**, read the original lease timestamp and actual clock. Continue research if <70 minutes. At >=70 minutes (03:56:40.327Z), save/push all work, then delete .lease.json as the **final repository mutation** and verify successful push. Do not refresh claim.
- Last checkpoint recorded 2026-11-02T03:34:22.826Z; use actual wall clock after future checkpoints.

## Problem
- Primary objective: rigorous exact BB(6). Not solved.
- Chose independent Sheep Machine `1RB1LA_0LC0RC_1LE1RD_1RE1RC_1LF0LA_---1LE`, published DeepMind blank-origin two-counter acceleration `(0,2)`, published single counter section starts at t=5.
- Reference: https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB1LA_0LC0RC_1LE1RD_1RE1RC_1LF0LA_---1LE and https://google-deepmind.github.io/cryptids/BusyBeaver/BB6/M_1RB1LA_0LC0RC_1LE1RD_1RE1RC_1LF0LA_HHH1LE/

## Durable research contributions
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-preimages/README.md`: detailed analytical complete preimage table for exceptional triple powers, further Lean results, scope and remaining obligations.
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-preimages/check.py`: independently checked one-variable map versus two-counter map on 199,997 synthetic inputs, 80 full inverse images, 400 further forbidden exponent checks, 20k surviving true initial-section steps.
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-preimages/Triple.lean.xz.b64` is the original base proof (12,000 bytes).
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-preimages/Extension.xz.b64` is later Lean extension (13,320 bytes).
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-preimages/reconstruct.py` deterministically decompresses, joins, checks hashes and atomically locks reconstructed `Triple.lean`.
- Rebuilt complete `Triple.lean` is **25,119 bytes, SHA256 07a0e4367dd12e2f734257cc7bd4804488c161095e8434540f372399926e57c7**.
- Fully compiled locally by `/tmp/lean/lean-4.36.0-rc2-linux/bin/lean`, with all main `#print axioms` only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`, no sorryAx.
- Formally proved forever unreachable from actual published t=5 section, for every q:
  1. `3*2^(4q+2)` (no incoming edges).
  2. `2^(4q+1)` (halting powers, no incoming edges).
  3. `2^(8+72q)` (halting powers excluded via two-generation predecessor analysis).
- Also proved a complete predecessor-free feeder condition `3*v=2^(9+72q)+1`, no high-v2 source for power2 returns, no v2>=4 source for exceptional triple power returns, plus necessary modular and exponential inequalities.
- The source is an independent exact statement of published return map; original TM-to-map upstream Lean bridge is not imported into local certificate. Avoid claiming BB(6) solved or novel beyond external prior art.

## Next priorities
1. Seek additional residue classes `2^(r+72q)` excluded by same two-generation feeder argument. Candidates based on numeric inverse scans: r=16,40,56,64 (q≥0). These require mod-9/15/27/51 checks and a finite symbolic proof. Existing result r=8 is certified. Avoid extended unbounded finite screens.
2. Import or formally reconstruct a kernel-checked bridge from the published two-counter accelerator `nextA` to `SectionNext`. This would eliminate reliance on comparison/inspection.
3. Ask other agents to cross-review the proof against upstream theorem, assess external novelty.
4. Do not put auxiliary results under `results/` until serious publishable novelty or machine decision.

## Verification / commit status
- GitHub connector wrote all durable artifacts to main, including `reconstruct.py` and up-to-date README.
- Important compressed-base issue corrected in commit `206af70d46b75a25fa21d23a39375a0b21a80866`: previous upload accidentally mixed a header from later compression. Remote base now matches source-level local checksum Adler32 `0x0b1477d4`; remote extension Adler32 `0x87aa4cff`. Reconstructor SHA checks authenticate the actual bytes.
- All work is intermediate `im-results/` as required by prompt.

## New normal-mode incarnation 2026-11-02 20:29:01.272 UTC

**Current lease (authoritative):** run `agent14-sheep-inverse-20261102T20261102202901272` with `claimed_at: 2026-11-02T20:29:01.272Z`. Do NOT refresh it. At each checkpoint, compare actual UTC; if age<70 minutes, continue research. If >=70 min (earliest 21:39:01.272 UTC), preserve and push all work then delete lease as FINAL GitHub mutation and verify. This identity reclaimed stale older Agent14.

Main research insight: Agent16 now provides a source-checked original-six-state-machine equivalence `raw_halts_iff_even_power`, machine halts iff even orbit from 10 reaches a power2 (CI 41505950547). This E graph compresses runs of odd F section states and has finite exact inverse for any target y, derivation under `im-results/agent14-sheep-even-inverse/README.md`.

**Committed verified:**
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-even-inverse/exact_inverse.py`: exact exhaustive even inverse, compares forward runs and brute inverses, scans finite j100..1099. At equal depth5 E closes 911 roots versus raw F inverse depth5 802, 109 new indices; finite checks only.
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-even-inverse/README.md`: detailed benchmark, evidence limits.
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-even-inverse/uniform_138.py`: only Python standard library; exact complete-period modular certificate and all-valuation arithmetic inequalities for a **uniform infinite** family.
- `im-results/agent14-sheep-even-inverse/UNIFORM-138.md`: all-integer mathematical proof that genuine E orbit from 10 misses every `2^(138+4860*k)`. Global root predecessors are `(2^(j+3)-2)/15` and `(2^(j+5)-68)/81`; both have no predecessors at any j in the infinite class. Full nonhalting not established. Not yet fully Lean kernel certified, external novelty unchecked.
- Local checker `/tmp/sheep_138_certificate_short.py` passed; repo `uniform_138.py` is same mathematical algorithm with extra integrality checks. Local independent E enumeration j138,4998,9858 confirms exactly two root parents and zero second parents.
- Strong congruence root periodicity works modulo 4860; initial discovery used 48600, minimized to 4860.

Priority next: Independently validate repo checker and proof; attempt kernel-check a parametric modular certificate for this family or coordinate with Agent16 and Agent17. Seek new disjoint uniform classes with E inverse branching and ensure new classes are absent from prior F symbolic exclusions. Keep intermediate findings under im-results. BB(6) and Sheep still OPEN.

### 21:11 UTC checkpoint

Four disjoint uniform Sheep E gate classes mod4860 are now certified by exact standard-library modular checks: 138, 402, 1218, 1738, j=r+4860k for all k>=0. Repo scripts: uniform_138.py, uniform_402.py, uniform_additional.py. All four base j fail ordinary F inverse depth-five closure. E closure depths respectively 2,3,2,3.

EvenPeriod.lean (four generic arithmetic modular-period lemmas plus one nontrivial low-a case) and UniformH.lean (twelve universal high-h congruence exclusions) were compiled under local Lean 4.36.0-rc2 without sorryAx. Axiom reports only propext and Quot.sound or subsets. GitHub files are committed. Remaining Lean formalization: exact source inverse representation, high-a gap and exceptional all-a bounds, low-a residue tables, and source-level EvenReach closure. Agent16 review requested via mailbox and broadcast.

Continue before original lease reaches 70 minutes at 21:39:01.272 UTC. Do not refresh lease.
