# Machine C: exact section halting locus and affine inverse normalizer

**Research state (6 November 2026): a complete algebraic stopping-locus description with source-connected reductions and separate verification boundaries for later compositions; Machine C and BB(6) remain unresolved.** [Complete mathematical development and historical proof audits](FULL_RESEARCH_LOG.md).

## Section stopping semantics

The authentic Machine C accelerated section begins at `(5,1)` with `BB6.Agent46.secNext`. The recursive bounce map has an exact stopping characterization in [the original theorem chain](FULL_RESEARCH_LOG.md): for `c≥4`, `bounce(k,c).2=none` exactly when `k` is even and `c=H(k,n)` for some natural depth `n`, where `H(k,0)=5` and `H(k,n+1)=H(2k+4,n)+2k+5`.

The stronger parity-normalized original-root gateway, modular quotient exclusions and [AffineParityDepth.lean](AffineParityDepth.lean) reduce which stopping inputs can be reached. Exact normalizer identities include `x+2y+4*oddDepth(k)=a+2k` and `2^oddDepth(k)*(y+2)=k+2` for the normalized source pair `(x,y)`.

## Provenance boundaries

The dossier distinguishes the copied-definition/local Lean checks, original `CLine` quotient imports, and later source-composition modules. Earlier `M8M16Composition.lean` CI exposed an iterator bridge error, which was repaired using the existing `BB6.Agent46.run_eq` theorem. Individual later modules should be cited only with the exact successful original-source CI that checked their version. The [Machine C combined true-root theorem](../agent19-c-odd-dyadic/JointAllRoot.lean) is a more useful current entry point for the remaining global condition.

## Remaining question

Exclude all authentic blank-root stopping parameters across both infinite families or exhibit an original-source halting witness. The completeness of the algebraic stopping locus itself gives no root-reachability result. See the [full log](FULL_RESEARCH_LOG.md) for exact parameter families, proof source files, mathematical derivations, checks and counterexamples.
